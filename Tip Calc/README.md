## My process
To build this Tip Calculator App, I started by analyzing the provided design from Frontend Mentor and structured the layout using semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO. I crafted the visual design with CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly layout across all screen sizes. The interactive functionality, including real-time tip and total calculations, was implemented using vanilla JavaScript, focusing on clean and efficient code. I continuously tested and refined the design using Chrome DevTools to optimize the appâ€™s responsiveness and user experience.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
